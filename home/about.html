        <p>
          MGM Academy is an upcoming learning institution based in a fast-growing residential area in Malaa along Kangundo Road, just after Joska. A peaceful, serene environment surrounded by nature where children can learn in tranquility and discover the importance of conservation. The school is committed to the best interests of students, guided by our core values and professional ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
          MGM Academy is built on the foundation of promoting the welfare of all children, nurturing their potential to allow them to freely express themselves and grow with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The school follows the Montessori teaching method for early years and graduates learners to the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). Our teaching style emphasizes exposure to nature and learning through play. In the early years, children are especially open to learning from their environments, encouraging a sense of unity with the natural world.
