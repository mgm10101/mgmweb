                        Our highly trained teachers help your child with key miles stones of this important
                        developmental stage in a caring environment that provides safety to have the freedom to explore
                        within boundaries. There is individual attention enrichment and praise. Releasing your child to
                        us must be difficult therefore we constantly communicate with you about all the important
                        moments of his/her day such as diapering, eating, sleeping and above all the exciting new
                        learning experiences he/she has had.

                        learning needs of the 5-year-old and prepare them for the transition. The curriculum focuses on
                        maths, writing, science, environmental and social development in a fun appropriate program. We
                        do not forget plenty of outdoor activities where your child will also learn while exercising
                        their body as well as his/her mind.

                        At MGM we are conscious of the developmental stages of the child and teach in tandem of this.
                        Students that graduate into grade 1 are usually at age 6+, this is the stage where children
                        learn through feeling. With a good foundation in their early years they start to make sense
                        their surroundings and absorb what they are taught like sponges. This is when they improve on
                        their reading skills, learn to put their thoughts and feelings into place. Our teaching is
                        learner centred and therefore we start our day with story time from both the children and the
                        teachers through story time we inspire the children and allow them to create their own story
                        using the environment as their guide or folk tales. The story of the day is then incorporated
                        into the learning activities of maths, language, sciences etc. We make learning fun and
                        acceptable for the students.
